 <p>This is an HTML5 clone of Mine Sweeper, the classic puzzle game. Clicking on a square reveals whether there is a mine underneath. If not, the number of adjacent mines is shown.</p>
 <p>You can choose from four difficulty levels: easy, normal, hard and extreme. Start playing the easy level, then go on with normal and if you're good enough, play rough!</p>
 <p>Also, the field size is variable. You can choose from 6x6 squares to 16x16 ones. The larger the field size, the higher the score. Simple, huh?</p>

 <p>The game features three styles. The third one makes the game special: Instead of numbers, circles indicate the number of adjacent mines.</p>
